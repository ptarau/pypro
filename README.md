## A nested tuple store for unification-based tuple mining.

* Terms are represented as nested tuples.

* A parser and scanner for a simplified Prolog term syntax is used
to turn terms into nested Python tuples.

* An indexer in combination with the unification algorithm is used
to retrieve ground terms matching terms containing logic variables.
